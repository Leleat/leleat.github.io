                    After completing my studies, I joined the Technical Tax
                    Office (TFA) Berlin, where I was responsible for the
                    development and maintenance of internal websites. During
                    this time, I gained hands-on experience in frontend
                    development with Vue.js and TailwindCSS, as well as backend
                    development using Node.js, Express, and SQLite.
                    Additionally, we started to switch to React for our
                    projects, broadening my technical expertise even further.

                    In March 2024, I completed my degree in Administrative
                    Informatics at the HWR Berlin, graduating as the top of my
                    class with honors. This achievement earned me the

                    Alongside my studies, I actively participated in the
                    open-source software community, gaining valuable practical
                    experience. I primarily focused on developing GNOME

                The apprenticeship I completed at the tax consultancy firm of

                back to my hometown, Magdeburg, where I also worked as a tax
                accountant assistant. Eventually, I decided to pursue a degree
                in Administrative Informatics at the HWR Berlin since my passion
                for technology was still going strong.

                After finishing school, I started studying computer science at
                the Otto-von-Guericke University in Magdeburg because computers
                always fascinated me. However, I didn't complete my studies
                there, as I was too young, too inexperienced, and too lazy. The
                studies were too theoretical for me. So I decided switch to
                something more practical and started an apprenticeship as a tax
                accountant assistant.
